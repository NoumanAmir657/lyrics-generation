Wake up to your dreams
And watch them come true
I'll make you whisper my name
And never leave the room
Night and day I'll be your muse
No other girl can make you feel the way I do

I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon,
I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere,
So meet me under there
I can make the stars dance, dance, dance for you, you, you

Don't be afraid, close your eyes
Let me take you to places that you've never been tonight
I thought by now you'd realize
I can do anything I put my mind to

I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon,
I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere,
So meet me under there
I can make the stars dance, dance, dance for you, you, you

Everything I touch turns to love
Everything I do will open up heaven
Instead-stead-stead of us falling, we're flying in love
Nothing's forever because we are just stars dust

I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon,
I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere,
So meet me under there
I can make the stars dance, dance, dance for you, you, you

I can make the stars dance
I can make the stars...
I can make, I can make, I can make, I-I-I can make the stars dance

The sky is everywhere,
So meet me under there

Trying not to roam but you're so...
Far away, so far away

Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never...
You never said, you never said

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would...
Go away... just go away!

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

You're a sexy machine, you're a Hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Let's drop out of this crowd,
Somewhere no one's allowed
I want you...

...all to myself,
I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah,
You don't need no other lover,
We can keep it undercover
Find me in the shadows,
And put the shades down until tomorrow
And make sure that no-nobody follows
You don't need no other lover,
We can keep it undercover

You don't need no other lover,
We can keep it undercover

I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark
And you can navigate me like a map that you know by heart, oh

Hey babe it's me, I just wanted to call to tell you that
I love you so so so so much,
Just wanted to let you know that you are my princess,
You are worthy of all of the love in the world,
You are the love of my life.

Now's all we got,
And time can't be bought,
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember

[Verse 1:]
You said you loved me,
I said I loved you back,
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

All your promises,
And all them plans we had,
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

Boom gone,
Yeah, we move on
Even if we try to forget

[Chorus:]
Love will remember you,
And love will remember me,
I know it inside my heart,
Forever will, forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember [x5]

[Verse 2:]
The trips we dreamed of takin',
The tacks left on the map,
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

When all you had was nothing,
And all we did was laugh,
What happened, what happened,
What happened to that?

Boom gone,
Yeah, we move on
Even if we try to forget

[Chorus:]
Love will remember you,
And love will remember me,
I know it inside my heart,
Forever will, forever be ours,
Even if we tried to forget
Love will remember [x9]

[Bridge:]
Break down the walls,
Let heaven in.
Somewhere in forever
We'll dance again.
We used to be inseparable.
I used to think that I was irreplaceable.
We lit the whole world up
Before we blew it up.
I still don't know just how we screwed it up
Forever [x3]

[Chorus:]
Love will remember you,
And love will remember me,
I know it inside my heart,
Forever will, forever be ours,
Even if we tried to forget
Love will remember [x9]

In the dark we can see
Feel your hand touching me
Run away from a world outside we know

In your lips I confide
In our love we can hide
Run away from a world outside we know

And when I'm wakin' next to you
I know I'm not the lonely people
That we used to be, used to be
I'm never givin' up on this

The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're takin' on me like I'm takin' on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you

'Cause we fit perfectly when you lay over me
Run away from a world outside we know

And when I'm wakin' next to you
I know I'm not the lonely people
That we used to be, used to be
I'm never givin' up on this

The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're takin' on me like I'm takin' on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you

The lover in me is the lover in you tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you tonight
And it's my favorite part
And it's my favorite part

The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're takin' on me like I'm takin' on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you
The lover in me is the lover in you
You're so hot (not?)
But if I can be honest
Baby, you're all that I've got
You're so cool (not?)
But if you didn't notice
You got me playing a fool
With you

'Cause you're not my type
This can't be true
I don't know why
I'm all about you
If it's real then tell me so
'Cause I'm not letting you go

We will never change
In and out of love but I like it that way
We will never change our minds
But I want you to stay up all night
We cross the line
'Cause wrong is right
When we're together
We will never change
In and out of love but I like it that way

You're so... you (ew, gross)
But there's something about you
It's making me feel like I do
With you

'Cause you're not my type
This can't be true
I don't know why
I'm all about you
If it's real then tell me so
'Cause I'm not letting you go

We will never change
In and out of love but I like it that way
We will never change our minds
But I want you to stay up all night
We cross the line
'Cause wrong is right
When we're together
We will never change
In and out of love but I like it that way

Not my type
This can't be, can't be true
We will
I'm all about, about
If it's real then tell me so
'Cause I'm not letting go

We will never change
In and out of love but I like it that way
We will never change our minds
But I want you to stay up all night
We cross the line
'Cause wrong is right
When we're together
We will never change
In and out of love but I like it that way
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known, I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now here's another one
So your melody will play on and on, with the best of 'em
You are beautiful, like a dream come alive, incredible
A centerfold miracle, lyrical
You saved my life again
And I want you to know baby

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby

And I keep hitting re-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby

And I keep hitting re-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat

Constantly, boy, you play through my mind like a symphony
There's no way to describe what you do to me
You just do to me, what you do
And it feels like I've been rescued
I've been set free
I am hypnotized by your destiny
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful
You are
And I want you to know, baby

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby

And I keep hitting re-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat

I, I love you like a (love song, baby) love song, baby
I, I love you like a (love song, baby) love song, baby
I, I love you (I love you, I love you) like a love song, baby

And I keep hitting re-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat (like a love song)

No one compares
You stand alone, to every record I own
Music to my heart that's what you are
A song that goes on and on

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby

And I keep hitting re-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby

I love you... like a love song
Everybody tells me that it's so hard to make it
It's so hard to break in
There's no way to fake it

Everybody tells me that it's wrong what I'm feelin'
And I shouldn't believe in
The dreams that I'm dreamin'

I hear it every day
I hear it all the time
I'm never gonna amount too much
But they're never gonna change my mind, no

[2x]
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't know,
Something I don't know
Something I don't know

Like how many inches in a mile?
What it takes to make you smile?
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't know,
Something I don't know
Something I don't know

Tell me, tell me something I don't know
Tell me, tell me something I don't know

Everybody tells me I don't know what I'm doing
This life I'm pursuing
The odds I'll be losing

Everybody tells me that it's one in a million, no
One in a billion, oh
One in a zillion

I hear it every day
I hear it all the time
I'm never gonna amount too much
But they're never gonna change my mind, no

[2x]
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't know,
Something I don't know
Something I don't know

Like how many inches in a mile?
What it takes to make you smile?
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't know,
Something I don't know
Something I don't know

[Rap:]
Selena hit the track
Like Katrina makin' waves
Like Cold Medina, make 'em say "I'm ready!"
Are you ready for it? 
Yeah, I'm ready for it
Really ready for it? 
Yeah, I'm ready for it

I'm on my way
I know I'm gonna get there someday
It doesn't help when you say
It won't be easy

[2x]
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't know,
Something I don't know
Something I don't know

Like how many inches in a mile?
What it takes to make you smile?
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby

[3x]
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't know,
Something I don't know
Something I don't know

Like how many inches in a mile?
What it takes to make you smile?
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Something I don't know,
Something I don't know
Something I don't know
I wouldn't wanna be anybody else, hey

[Verse 1:]
You made me insecure,
Told me I wasn't good enough.
But who are you to judge
When you're a diamond in the rough?
I'm sure you got some things
You'd like to change about yourself.
But when it comes to me
I wouldn't want to be anybody else.

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na

I'm no beauty queen
I'm just beautiful me

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na

You've got every right
To a beautiful life
C'mon

[Chorus:]
Who says, who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurtin'?
Trust me, that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty?
Who says you're not beautiful?
Who says?

[Verse 2:]
It's such a funny thing
How nothing's funny when it's you
You tell 'em what you mean
But they keep whiting out the truth
It's like a work of art
That never gets to see the light
Keep you beneath the stars
Won't let you touch the sky

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na

I'm no beauty queen
I'm just beautiful me

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na

You've got every right
To a beautiful life
C'mon

[Chorus:]
Who says, who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurtin'?
Trust me, that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty?
Who says you're not beautiful?
Who says?

[Bridge:]
Who says you're not star potential?
Who says you're not presidential?
Who says you can't be in movies?
Listen to me, listen to me
Who says you don't pass the test?
Who says you can't be the best?
Who said, who said?
Would you tell me who said that?
Yeah, who said?

[Chorus:]
Who says, who says you're not perfect? (yeah)
Who says you're not worth it? (yeah yeah)
Who says you're the only one that's hurtin'? (oh)
Trust me, that's the price of beauty (hey yeah, beauty)
Who says you're not pretty? (who said?)
Who says you're not beautiful? (I'm just beautiful me)
Who says?

Who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurtin'?

Trust me (yeah), that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty?
Who says you're not beautiful? (who says you're not beautiful?)
Who says?
You make me so upset sometimes
I feel like I could lose my mind
The conversation goes nowhere
'Cause you're never gonna take me there

And I know, what I know
And I know you're no good for me
Yeah I know, what I know
And I know it's not meant to be

Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head (can't get you out of my)

And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted
To my dilemma, my dilemma
It's you, it's you

Your eyes have told a thousand lies
But I believe them when they look in mine
I heard the rumors but you won't come clean
I guess I'm hoping it's because of me

And I know, what I know
And I know you're no good for me
Yeah I know, what I know
And I know it's not meant to be

Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head (can't get you out of my)

And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted 
To my dilemma, my dilemma
It's you, it's you

One day I want you
And then I don't
I'm gonna leave you
And then I won't.
I can't live live with or without you
I can't live live with or without you

Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head (can't get you out of my)

And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted 
To my dilemma, my dilemma
It's you, it's you

(It's you, it's you)
It's you, it's you
It's you, it's you (it's you)
It's you, it's you, it's you (my-my-my dilemma)
'Round and 'round
'Round and 'round
'Round and 'round
'Round and 'round

You see me standing there
And act like you don't know me
But last night you were calling me
Saying you want me

Oh why you always make me feel
Like I'm the one that's crazy
You feel my heart racing
My, my heart racing

Boy, I need you here with me
We can't go on this way
I'm falling hard for you
All I can say

We're going 'round and 'round
We're never gonna stop going
'Round and 'round
We'll never get where we're going
'Round and 'round
Well you're gonna miss me
'Cause I'm getting dizzy going
'Round and 'round and 'round

You try to pull me close
And whisper in my ear
You always told me lies
I've cried out all my tears

I push my feelings to the side
But then you bring them back
Bring-bring them back
Now you got me singing

Boy, I need you here with me
We can't go on this way
I'm falling hard for you
All I can say

We're going 'round and 'round
We're never gonna stop going
'Round and 'round
We'll never get where we're going
'Round and 'round
Well you're gonna miss me
'Cause I'm getting dizzy going
'Round and 'round and 'round

[2x]
Love me or love me not
I'm staring at the clock
I pick them flower petals off
And then I watch them drop

Boy, I need you here with me
I can't go on this way
I'm falling hard for you
All I can say

'Round and 'round
We're never gonna stop going
'Round and 'round
We'll never get where we're going
'Round and 'round
Well you're gonna miss me
'Cause I'm getting dizzy going
'Round and 'round and

'Round and 'round
We're never gonna stop going
'Round and 'round
We'll never get where we're going
'Round and 'round
Well you're gonna miss me
'Cause I'm getting dizzy going
'Round and 'round and 'round
I told, I told, I told myself again
I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but you're so...
Far away, so far away

Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never...
You never said, you never said

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would...
Go away... just go away!

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

Forget forever
Forget forever
Now that I have captured your attention
I wanna steal ya for a rhythm intervention
Mr. TSA*, I'm ready for inspection
Sh-sh-show me how you make a first impression

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow
Break it down and drop it low, low
'Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights 'til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit "Rewind"
All night long
Baby, slow down the song

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

If you want me I'm accepting applications
So long as we can keep this record on rotation
You know I'm good with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Breathe me in, breathe me out
So amazing

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow
Break it down and drop it low, low
'Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights 'til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit "Rewind"
All night long
Baby, slow down the song

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

Breathe me in, breathe me out
The music's got me going
Breathe me in, breathe me out
No stopping 'til the morning
Breathe me in, breathe me out
You know I'm ready for it,
For it, for it!
Yeah!

Breathe me in, breathe me out
The music's got me going
Breathe me in, breathe me out
No stopping 'til the morning
Breathe me in, breathe me out
You know I'm ready for it,
For it, for it!
Yeah!

(i-i-it's the cataracts)

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit "Rewind"
All night long
Baby, slow down the song

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

How do I do it?
I-i-it's the cataracts

(ha, ha, ha, ha)

[* Transportation Security Administration]
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Can you feel me
When I think about you?
With every breath I take
Every minute
No matter what I do

My world is an empty place
Like I've been wandering the desert
For a thousand days (oh)
Don't know if it's a mirage
But I always see your face, baby

[Chorus:]
I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain (oh, whoa)
Whoa, oh, whoa

The stars are burning
I hear your voice in my mind (voice in my mind)
Can't you hear me calling?
My heart is yearning
Like the ocean that's running dry
Catch me, I'm falling

It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet
Won't you save me?
There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me, oh, baby

[Chorus]

So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
I'm so glad you found me
Stick around me,
Baby baby baby oooh

It's a world of wonder with you in my life
So hurry, baby, don't waste no more time
I need you here, I can't explain
But a day without you is like a year without rain (oh, whoa)

[Chorus]

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
How you choose to express yourself
It's all your own and I can tell
It comes naturally, it comes naturally

You follow what you feel inside
It's intuitive, you don't have to try
It comes naturally, mmmm, it comes naturally

And it takes my breath away (away, away, away)
What you do so naturally (turally, turally, turally)

You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are and to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Ba-ba-baby

You have a way of moving me
A force of nature, your energy
It comes naturally (you know it does), it comes naturally
Mmmm, yeah

And it takes my breath away (away, away) every time
What you do so naturally

You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are and to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Ba-ba-baby

When we collide sparks fly
When you look in my eyes
It takes my breath away

You are

You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are and to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Ba-ba-baby

Everything, baby, comes naturally
Quiero más.

Cae la noche, yo a tu lado,
viendo estrellas que al brillar,
nos invitan a soñar.
No tengamos tanto miedo,
que al mostrar nuestro querer,
nada nos podrá vencer.

Tu y yo seremos la pareja ideal
y juntos volaremos hasta el mas allá.

Tu y yo libres como el viento,
tu y yo hasta el firmamento,
Arriesgate y veras,
que pronto pedirás,
más más más (Quiero más).

Tu y yo dos sobrevivientes,
tu y yo siempre diferentes,
Que importa el que dirán,
Contigo quiero estar más más más.

Quiero mas (Más).

Ven y dime, al oído,
que no puedes ya vivir, sin estar cerca de mi,
siente como, mis latidos,

Tu y yo libres como el viento,

Me canta asi, me canta a ti
Cada vez que lo veo pasar

Bidi bidi bom bom
Bidi bidi bom bom
Bidi bidi bidi bidi bidi bom bom
Bidi bidi bidi bidi bidi bom bom
Oh-oh oh ooh-ooh-ooh

You walk and talk like you're some new sensation
You move in circles you don't need an invitation
You spend your money - you can't get no satisfaction
You play it right so you can get the right reaction

It won't be long, my darling
Pick up the phone, nobody's on it
Where are your friends now, baby?
All of the ones supposed to be there for you, you

When you're falling down
The world starts spinning round you, you
When you're falling down
Now it's not all about you, you
When you're falling down
You know I'll be around
When you're falling down, falling down

Falling down, you're falling down, you're falling down

What's outta place when you look into the mirror?
The truth is blurry but the lies are gettin' clearer
Your eyes are fixed, your
Smile is so elastic
You give me roses but they're all just made of plastic

It won't be long, my darling
Pick up the phone, nobody's on it
Where are your friends now, baby?
All of the ones supposed to be there for you, you

When you're falling down
The world starts spinning round you, you
When you're falling down
Now it's not all about you, you
When you're falling down
You know I'll be around
When you're falling down, you're falling down

Smile for the camera
Everybody's looking at ya
Smile for the camera
If they're all about to trash you
Smile for the camera, camera, camera
Smile for the camera
Who's gonna catch you?

Ah, ah, ah, you, you

When you're falling down
The world starts spinning round you, you
When you're falling down
Now it's not all about you, you
When you're falling down
You know I'll be around
When you're falling down, you're falling down

Smile for the camera
Everybody's looking at you
Smile for the camera
If they're all about to trash you
Sitting on my bed with just your t-shirt on
Turning up the volume to my favorite song
Boy I can't lie
What we did last night
You know it's constantly replaying, staying on my mind

I'll show you what I like boy boy boy,
If you show me what you like boy boy boy,
I'll show you what I like,
Show you what I like like,
If you show me what you like boy

If I had a choice
If I had my way
Boy you know we'd do it every single day
If I had a wish
And if I had my way
Boy you know we'd do it every single day

Damn
Wish I didn't feel so hypnotized,
But when I look at you baby it's justified,
So I take what I want,
And give what I got,
To help with all the rules that keep us civilized

I'll show you what I like boy boy boy,
If you show me what you like boy boy boy,
I'll show you what I like,
Show you what I like like,
If you show me what you like boy

If I had a choice
If I had my way
Boy you know we'd do it every single day
If I had a wish
And if I had my way
Boy you know we'd do it every single day

No where I'd rather be
Than anywhere alone, just you and me
I'll be your Tonto, you'll be my Clyde
We'll be together forever we'll ride
I want you more and more
You're hotter today than the day before
No lie, no lie, no lie, no lie

If I had a choice
If I had my way
Boy you know we'd do it every single day
If I had a wish
And if I had my way
Boy you know we'd do it every single day

I'll show you what I like boy boy boy,
If you show me what you like boy boy boy,
I'll show you what I like,
Show you what I like like,
If you show me what you like boy
I dive into the future
But I'm blinded by the sun
I'm reborn in every moment
So who knows what I'll become

I feel like I've awakened lately
The chains around me are finally breaking
I've been under self-restoration
I'm becoming my own salvation
Showing up, no more hiding, hiding
The light inside me is bursting, shining
It's my, my, my time to butterfly

What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival

I'll walk through the fire, I'll begin again
I'll burn through my skin
Cause I, cause I wanna feel it
Reaching for the truth, not afraid to lose
What shattered through me like a rifle (rifle) was a revival, revival, yeah
I admit, it's been painful, painful
But I'll be honest, I'm grateful, grateful
It's my, my, my time to realize

What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Revival

What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival, This is a revival
The world can be a nasty place
You know it, I know it, yeah
We don't have to fall from grace
Put down the weapons you fight with

And kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

We're running out of time
Chasing our lies
Every day a small piece of you dies
Always somebody
You're willing to fight, to be right

Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
And no war in anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you're fighting

Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now

Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
And no war in anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you're fighting

Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now
Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice

So come on, give me a taste
Of what it's like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice

Oh, 'cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying

But I...

Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

The doctors say you're no good
But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
I'd breathe you in every single day

Oh, 'cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying

But I...

Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Oh, I, I want it all
I want it all
I want it all, ooh

Can't keep my hands to myself
I mean, I could but why would I want to?

My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep, keep my hands to myself

I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, 'ow

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh (that same old love) [2x]
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh (that same old love) [2x]

I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know

You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, 'ow

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh (that same old love) [2x]
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh (that same old love) [2x]

I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love [4x]

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh (that same old love) [2x]
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh (that same old love) [2x]
We fall for each other at the wrong time
Only for a moment, but I don't mind
Guess I don't know where to draw the line, the line, the line
And we'll play the same game every night

Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh, I know, yeah I know, it's over

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
You're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

Why is it so different when we wake up?
Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch
Don't you know that you doing just enough, but not enough?
But I know what's next, and I want so much

Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh, I know, yeah I know, it's over

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
You're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
Yeah!

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
You're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

You've got a hold on me
You're like a wasted dream
I give you everything
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober
I'm on my 14 carats
I'm 14 carat
Doing it up like Midas, mhm
Now you say I gotta touch
So good, so good
Make you never wanna leave
So don't, so don't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh

I'm in my marquise diamonds
I'm a marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mhm
You say I give it to you hard
So bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave
I won't, I won't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to how you're breathing

'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you,

Uh-huh, uh-huh, ah...
Uh-huh, uh-huh, ah, mhm...

Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I

[A$AP Rocky:]
Hold on, take a minute, love
'Cause I ain't trying to mess your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to mess your fitness up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, the signature
Any time I hit it, know she feelin' for it through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next chick
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot (Whoo!)
Just met a bad miss without the ass shots (Whoo!)
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?

[Selena:]
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Baby let me be good to you, good to you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh, uh-huh, ah...
Uh-huh, uh-huh...

Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I
Dead-end streets and boulevards
You threw in the towel, I broke your heart
But there's a first time for everything
Who would've thought you'd feel so cold
And all these memories seem so old
To think you were my everything

Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflaged
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

Riding alone on the 405
And life's so fragile, it's like I could cry
If that's the last time I'd see you again
But I'll never tell you just how I felt
You might just not care, and it might just not help
What if the feelings just don't make no sense to you, you

Remember when we'd talk all night
Time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflaged
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflaged
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are, who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride
Ooh, the rhythm takes you over
Takes you to a different place
A different space
Ooh, the smoke is getting closer
I can feel our young blood race
Through cityscapes

And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do its stuff
'Til the energy is too much

Yeah all I need
Is the rhythm, me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah the rhythm, me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah the rhythm, me and the rhythm

Ooh, I start to feel it now
Feeling like I'm truly free
I'm free in me
Ooh, the heat's a common ground
No matter what's your history
Be free with me

And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do its stuff
'Til the energy is too much

Yeah all I need
Is the rhythm, me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah the rhythm, me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah the rhythm, me and the rhythm

If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark

Yeah all I need
Is the rhythm, me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah the rhythm, me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah the rhythm, me and the rhythm
[Intro:]
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
Mmm

[Verse 1:]
You built me from a broken heart
With bricks you made from broken parts
You've fixed the pain, so we could start
So now what's mine is ours
I still have proof in form of scars
The first time always falls so far
Those healing wounds heal twice as hard
But now what's mine is ours
But now what's mine is ours

[Chorus:]
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild

[Verse 2:]
My sweet devoted counterpart
We catch each other's shooting stars
However close, however far
Whatever's mine is ours
Whatever's mine is ours

[Chorus:]
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors (we are survivors)
We are survivors of the wild

[Bridge:]
Whoa (we are, we are)
Whoa (we are, we are)
Whoa (we are, we are)
We are survivors of the wild
Whoa (we are, we are)
Whoa (we are, we are)
Whoa (we are, we are)
We are survivors of the wild

[Outro:]
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors (whoa)
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors (we are survivors)
We are survivors of the wild
I'm going in, I'm ready to surrender
Like a diamond, I need a little pressure
So press me down 'til I scream
If you're the flame, I'm kerosene
I'm burning up, baby

All I need, all I need is your body heat
Right next to me
All I need, all I need is your body heat
Oh my God it feels amazing when you hold me close
Know me like the summer, baby don't let go
I got body heat

[Repeat in background:]
Give it to me

I'm burning up, baby
Got body heat
All I want is your body
Got body heat

Burn it up, burn it up
So give it up, give it up
Got body heat
All I need, all I need is your body heat

I'm restless, I'm craving your attention
My red lips have found a new obsession
Let's go all night, just you and me
If you're the flame, I'm kerosene
I'm burning up, baby

All I need, all I need is your body heat
Right next to me
All I need, all I need is your body heat
Oh my God it feels amazing when you hold me close
Know me like the summer, baby don't let go
I got body heat

[Repeat in background:]
Give it to me

I'm burning up, baby
Got body heat
All I want is your body
Got body heat

Burn it up, burn it up
So give it up, give it up
Got body heat
All I need, all I need is your body heat

All I need, all I need is your body heat
Right next to me
All I need, all I need is your body heat
Right next to me

I'm burning up, burning up, you're right there I like it
Bring your body, bring your body, bring your body right next to me

I'm burning up, burning up, you're right there I like it
Bring your body, bring your body, bring your body right next to me

We're connected by the sun
And all of the stars above
You melt me and my body feels no shame

And I don't care tonight
If it burns too bright
'Cause baby, that's why I came

All I need, all I need is your body heat
Right next to me
All I need, all I need is your body heat
Right next to me

Bring your body, bring your body, bring your body right next to me

[Repeat in background:]
Give it to me

All I need, all I need is your body heat
Right next to me
All I need, all I need is your body heat
Oh my God it feels amazing when you hold me close
Know me like the summer, baby don't let go
I got body heat

[Repeat in background:]
Give it to me

I'm burning up, baby
Got body heat
All I want is your body
Got body heat
Got your body, got your body

I got your body, got your body
Got your body, got your body got your body heat right next to me

Got body heat
All I need, all I need is your body heat
Got body heat

Burn it up, burn it up
So give it up, give it up
Got body heat
All I need, all I need is your body heat
You can stand beside the madness like a falling tear
You can hold onto the sadness like a souvenir
Or you can close your eyes and see your life
Like the air

You can tap into the strength you never knew you had
You can breathe into your faith no matter where you're at
Just close your eyes and change your life
Like the air

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
You can rise
Like the air you can
Rise

The earth can pull you down with all its gravity
And the measure of your worth is sometimes hard to see
So just hold on, when the night is done
Like the sun

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
You can rise
Like the air you can
Rise

So even when your bones feel like weights
And it's hard to lift the smile on your perfect face
You can still find a peaceful place
Close your eyes until you're floating up in outer space
It'll be alright, they're just jealous of your highs
So they can knock you down, but

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
You can rise
Like the air you can
Rise
Like the air you can
Rise
Drop down on a desert ride
Just outside the 95
Never felt more, more alive
I got my chicas by my side

And if we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
But you don't understand
I don't need a man

Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls

The night is dark but the moon is bright
We're staring at this summer night
Tan skin looks damn good in white
Stripping down by the Hollywood sign

And if we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
But you don't understand
I don't need a man

Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls

I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's
Me and my girls, me and my girls
You can look, but don't touch
I'm not here to hook up
I'm just here to turn up
Tonight is just us

Me and my girls
Tonight
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
No heart, no hands, no skin, no touch
Can get me there, nowhere enough
To love me like you do, to love me like you do
No kiss, no lips, no feel, no rush
Can keep me high, I swear no one
Can love me like you do, can love me like you do, oh

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, nobody ooh

No oxygen, could barely breathe
My darkest sin, you've raised release
And it's all because of you, all because of you
I don't know what it is, but you've pulled me in
No one compares, could ever begin
To love me like you do
Hmm I wouldn't want them to
Cause...

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you

Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

I don't want nothing else
Not when I've had the best
I don't want nothing else
Cause you showed me the best

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh
Different inflection when you say my name
Kiss me, but your kiss don't taste the same
Is it real or am I going out of my mind?
Curious 'bout the company that you keep
'Cause I hear you talking 'bout her in your sleep
And now you've got me talking 'bout her in mine

Ooh, and I bet, she has it all
Bet she's beautiful like you, like you
And I bet she's got that touch
Makes you fall in love, like you, like you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
Ay she's perfect
Ay she's perfect

How does she touch you? Can I try it, too?
I know you're twisted, but baby, I'm twisted, too
I wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind

Ooh, with the smell of her perfume
I could love her, too, like you, like you
And I can almost hear her laugh
Curving on her back for you, for you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
Ay she's perfect

I can see her body rushing into you
Crashing on your skin
Burning within, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin next to me
She's crashing on your skin
Settling in, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin while you sleep, uh

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
Ay she's perfect
I know you're loco
But it feels too good, yeah
I know you're loco

They say you shouldn't sleep with
Someone crazier than you
Cr-Cr-Crazier than you
No one's crazier than you
But you're so irresistible
I had to break the rules
Your temper can be sexy
I love it when you hate me

It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
And into your arms again
Uh oh I know you're loco
Uh oh I know you're...
Uh oh I know you're loco
But feels too good, yo

Uh oh I know you're loco
Uh oh I know you're...
Uh oh I know you're loco
But feels too good, yob

They say you shouldn't sleep with
Someone crazier than you
Cr-Cr-Crazier than you
No one's crazier than you
But you're so unforgettable
I had to break the rules
Your eyes are like a weapon
They'd kill me if I let 'em

It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
And into your arms again
Uh oh I know you're loco
Uh oh I know you're...
Uh oh I know you're loco
But feels too good, yo

Uh oh I know you're loco
Uh oh I know you're...
Uh oh I know you're loco
But feels too good, yo

I just can't get enough of you
I just can't get enough of you, ooh
I just can't get enough of you
I just can't get enough of you
I just can't get enough of you

It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
And into your arms again
Uh oh I know you're loco
Uh oh I know you're...
Uh oh I know you're loco
But feels too good, yo

Uh oh I know you're loco
Uh oh I know you're...
Uh oh I know you're loco
But feels too good, yo

But it feels too good, yeah
Uh oh, I know you're loco
Uh oh, I know you're...
Uh oh, I know you're loco
But it feels too good, yeah
There's a reason you're everywhere
Breathe you in like you're in the air
Maybe you should call off today
Give you girls some time to play
In my room, from the ceiling to the floor
My body knows that you've been here before

Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne

Maybe you should call off today
Give you girls some time to play
Running my mind cause my heart lost all control (oh no)
Only one thing that can give me that multiple

Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne, cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne

All the way down
Feels like you're all round
Forever in the moment
I love it, and you know it
All the way down
Feels like you're all round
Forever in the moment

Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne, cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Baby, you've been so distant from me lately
And lately don't even wanna call you "baby"

Saw us getting older
Burning toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high
Waiting up for you upstairs
Why you act like I'm not there?
Baby, right now it feels like

It feels like you don't care
Oh, why don't you recognize I'm so rare?
Always there
You don't do the same for me
That's not fair

I don't have it all
I'm not claiming to
But I know that I'm special, yeah
And I'll bet there's somebody else out there
To tell me I'm rare, to make me feel rare

To stay with you
No reason why you and I are not succeeding

They fell in love one summer
A little too wild for each other
Shiny till it wasn't
Feels good till it doesn't

It was her first real lover
His too till he had another
Oh god when she found out
Trust levels went way down

Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet

Took a few years
To soak up the tears
But look at her now
Watch her go

Mmm mmm mmm
Look at her now
Watch her go
Mmm mmm mmm
Wow
Look at her now
Mmm mmm mmm
Look at her now
Watch her go
Mmm mmm mmm
Wow
Look at her now

Fast nights that got him
That new life was his problem
Not saying she was perfect
Still regrets that moment

Like that night
Wasn't wrong, wasn't right
What a thing to be human
Made her more of woman

Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet

Took a few years
To soak up the tears
But look at her now
Watch her go

Mmm mmm mmm
Look at her now
Watch her go
Mmm mmm mmm
Wow
Look at her now

(She knows she will)
Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love
Wow

Look at her now
You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off-key in my chorus
'Cause it wasn't yours
I saw the signs and I ignored it
Rose-colored glasses all distorted
Set fire to my purpose
And I let it burn
You got off on the hurtin'
When it wasn't yours, yeah

We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me

I gave my all and they all know it
You tore me down and now it's showing
In two months you replaced us
Like it was easy
Made me think I deserved it
In the thick of healing, yeah

We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me

You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off key in my chorus

To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah

To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah

And now the chapter is closed and done
To love love, yeah
To love love, yeah
To love, yeah
And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us
You're all in your feelings baby
All into me
I'm one in a billion baby
Don't you agree?
Obviously, you know I'm aware of that
I'm breaking hearts like a heart attack
Got him right where the karats at

Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
They just like puppets on a string, string, string
I put it down, they call me up
They doing way too much
So I just let it ring, ring, ring (Ooh ooh)

Yeah, I received your message, all twenty-three (Twenty-three)
You know I'm Jordan with it, G-O-A-T (G-O-A-T)
Obviously, you know I'm aware of that
I'm breaking hearts like a heart attack
I got him right where the karats at

Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
They just like puppets on a string, string, string
I put it down, they call me up
They doing way too much
So I just let it ring, ring, ring

Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
They want to give me everything, thing, thing
I put it down, they call me up
(Oh, no-no-no-no-no)
So I just let it ring, ring, ring

Circling me they just like satellites
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Circling me, all day and every night
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Circling me, I'm sure you sympathize
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh-na-na

Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
They just like puppets on a string, string, string
I put it down, they call me up
They doing way too much
So I just let it ring, ring, ring

Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
They want to give me everything, thing, thing
I put it down, they call me up
(Oh, no-no-no-no-no)
So I just let it ring, ring, ring
If I gave you every piece of me, I know that you could drop it
Give you the chance, I know that you could take advantage once you got it
If I open up my heart to you, I know that you could lock it
Throw away the key and keep it there forever in your pocket

If I gave the opportunity to you, then would you blow it?
If I was the greatest thing that happened to you, would you know it?
If my love was like a flower, would you plant it, would you grow it?
I might give you all my body, are you strong enough to hold it?

If I show you all my demons
And we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets
Wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable

If I hand you my emotion, would you even want to take it?
If I give you all my trust now, would you fumble it and break it?
If I let you cross my finish line, then would you wanna make it?
I think I'm ready, won't you come and flip the switch and activate it?

If I show you all my demons
And we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets
Wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable

If I show you all my demons
And we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets
Wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah

If I show you all my demons
And we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before? (I'll stay vulnerable)
I would tell you all my secrets
Wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

(I'll stay vulnerable, yeah)
You were running through me like water
Now the feeling's leaving me dry
These days we couldn't be farther
So how's it feel to be on the other side?

So many wasted nights with you
I still can taste it, I hate it
Wish I could take it back, 'cause

We used to be close, but people can go
From people you know to people you don't
And what hurts the most is people can go
From people you know to people you don't

We used to be close, but people can go
From people you know to people you don't
And what hurts the most is people can go
From people you know to people you don't

When it was good, we were on fire
Now I'm breathing ashes and dust
I always wanna get higher
I never know when enough is enough

So many wasted nights with you
I still can taste it, I hate it
Wish I could take it back, 'cause

We used to be close, but people can go
From people you know to people you don't
And what hurts the most is people can go
From people you know to people you don't

We used to be close, but people can go
From people you know to people you don't
And what hurts the most is people can go
From people you know to people you don't

(People you don't)
(People you don't)
From people you know to people you don't
From people you know to people you don't

We used to be close, but people can go
From people you know to people you don't
And what hurts the most is people can go
From people you know to people you don't

We used to be close, but people can go
From people you know to people you don't
And what hurts the most is people can go
From people you know to people you don't

From people you know to people you don't
From people you know to people you don't
From people you know to people you don't
From people you know to people you don't
'Like a Prayer' surrounding us, moving effortlessly
Every word is relief
I'm on dance-floor therapy, all my babies and me
But tonight it's for free

No self-sabotage, no letting my thoughts run
Me and the spiral are done
Burn this camouflage I've been wearing for months
Tryna let a little happy in for once

I need to let my mind rest
While my body reflects

Ah ooh, don't get me down, I won't let me get me
Ah ooh, don't get me down, I won't let me get me
Ah ooh, I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside
Out

Diving in ferociously, dancing intimately
I'm so connected to me
In the dark I'm letting go so anonymously
I guess this is what it feels like to be free

I need to let my mind rest
While my body reflects

Ah ooh, don't get me down, I won't let me get me
Ah ooh, don't get me down, I won't let me get me
Ah ooh, I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside

Out, don't get me down, I won't let me get me
Ah ooh, don't get me down, I won't let me get me
Ah ooh, I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside

Oh my! I guess this is what it feels like to be free
Oh my! I guess this is what it feels like to see me

(Down)
(Get down)
Don't get me
(Down)
Oh oh
(Get down)
Don't get me
Ah ooh
(Get down)
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside

Out, don't get me down, I won't let me get me
Ah ooh, don't get me down, I won't let me get me
Ah ooh, I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside out
Out
Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah

It started polite, out on thin ice
Till you came over to break it
I threw you a line and you were mine

Yeah, I was afraid, but you made it safe
I guess that is our combination
Said you feel lost, well, so do I

So won't you call me in the morning?
I think that you should call me in the morning
If you feel the same, 'cause

Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah

Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah

Engulfed in the flames
Engulfed in the shame
Betrayed by your imagination
In over my head, but that's alright

So won't you call me in the morning?
I think that you should call me in the morning
If you feel the same, 'cause

Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah

Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you

The world keeps on spinning, but I ain't dizzy yet, yeah
The more that you give, give, give, give, the more that you get

It's just us two in the crowd, we feel alone
I turn every chair that you sit in into a throne
Not too many of 'em put it down like me
I say it humbly, but they don't wear the crown like me
It's all in your eyes, locked, loaded, we were rolling
You make the whole room feel slow-motion
You make me feel like I'm drowning in a potion
Closed off, tryna get a little open
The more that I give, the more that I get
So baby, I'ma call you in the a.m.
Get down for my love, honey, say when
I be waitin' on my time 'cause I'm patient

Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah

Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah
Hey
You started out sweeter than hard candy
Words were like licorice to the taste
But slowly, all the sugar, it went to waste
Went to waste

Oh
You started getting funny with no jokes
I started seeing through you like a ghost
And now I'm pretty sure I can't take no more
I can't take no more, oh

I think you're kind of crazy
And not the good kind, baby
'Cause you're acting super shady
You know it, you know it
Been dodging phone calls lately
But still texting me, baby
Yeah, I think you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

You've been lying just for fun
Luckily no damage done
But now I see you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

Oh-hoh
Oh-hoh, hmm-hmm
Oh-hoh
Oh-hoh, hmm-hmm

Hey
You're the one who started talkin' to me
Made the move, asked me to be your bae
And now you're treating me like I'm insane
You're insane

I think you're kind of crazy
And not the good kind, baby
'Cause you're acting super shady
You know it, you know it
Been dodging phone calls lately
But still texting me, baby
Yeah, I think you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

You've been lying just for fun
Luckily no damage done
But now I see you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

Yeah, I think you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

Oh-hoh
Oh-hoh, hmm-hmm
Oh-hoh
Oh-hoh, hmm-hmm
This is just what the doctor ordered
Put a gold star on my disorder
Yeah, we've talked around every corner
If I'm looking at you and me, we're on some kind of symmetry

I'm a sensitive situation
You're a hot and cold combination
Oh, we both know we got complications
If I'm looking at you and me, we're on some kind of symmetry, oh

I try not to bother, not to bother you (Ah-ah-ah)
But my kind of trouble, likes your trouble too

Can't stop myself, it's true
I like the way you move, uh-huh
Oh we got something in this room, can't make that up
You may not be the one, uh-huh

But you look like fun (Uh-uh-oh, ah, uh-uh-oh)
You look like fun (Ooh fun, uh-uh-oh, ah, uh-uh-oh)

Can we keep it on a first name basis?
We could overcrowd each others spaces
You get me higher than my medication
Take me to different places, let's face it, I'm getting impatient

I try not to bother, not to bother you (Ah-ah-ah)
But my kind of trouble, likes your trouble too (What?)

Can't stop myself, it's true
I like the way you move, uh-huh
Oh we got something in this room, can't make that up
You may not be the one, uh-huh

But you look like fun (Mmm, uh-uh-oh, ah, uh-uh-oh)
You look like fun (Ooh, uh-uh-oh, ah, uh-uh-oh)

You look like you don't, but you know how
Like a beautiful breakdown, and it's just not really
But you look like you don't, but you know how
Make me want to slow down, and it's just not right

That you like fun (Yeah, uh-uh-oh, ah, uh-uh-oh)
You look like fun (Ooh fun, uh-uh-oh, ah, uh-uh-oh)
You look like fun
Pull up to the mirror, staring at my face
Gotta chop-chop all the extra weight
I've been carrying it for fourteen-hundred and sixty days
Gotta, gotta, gotta clean my slate

And I might as well just tell you while I'm drunk, yeah
The truth is that I think I've had enough
Professionally messing with my trust
How could I confuse that shit for love?

So I gotta get
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just cut you off
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just cut you off
When I'm without
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I don't overthink it, I just carry on, get
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just cut you off

I imagine all the endless places I could know
With a drop-drop and I let you go
All the possibilities I've got from head to toe
Yeah they'd, yeah they'd, yeah they'd start to show

And I might as well just tell you while I'm drunk, yeah
The truth is that I think I've had enough
Emotionally messing with my health
How could I confuse that shit for love?

So I gotta get
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just cut you off
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just cut you off
When I'm without
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just, I just

You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
(I just)
(When I'm without)
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now

So I gotta get
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just (I just) cut you off (Yeah, I cut you off)
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just cut you off
When I'm without
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I don't overthink it, I just carry on, get
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh out my head now
I just, I just, yeah
Is there a place where I can hide away?
Red lips, french-kiss my worries all away
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugar-coat the taste
Sweeter place
There must be a sweeter

(Place where I can)

(Ooh) You really wanna know where I've been all this time
So let me tell ya
(Ooh) Got two feet on the ground and felt what real is like
What it was like living out of the scene, out in the wild
Learning to breathe up in the clouds, far from the crowds
I can't believe I can be loud
Holding hands with the darkness
And knowing my heart is allowed
Allowed

Is there a place where I can hide away?
Red lips, french-kiss my worries all away
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugar-coat the taste
A sweeter place
There must be a sweeter

(Place where I can)

(Place where I can)

As I fantasize
So much to see, I'm in paradise
Oh I, always seems I'm new inside
Deep, deep down in me, I go now baby, born to fly
Oh I, now, see, how could it be
We will find our way, we'll find the things we seek
Ooh we, you see I'm mesmerized
Place that's just for me and I am cutting ties
Goodbye (Hmmm)

Is there a place where I can hide away? (Hide away)
Red lips, french-kiss my worries all away (All away)
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugar-coat the taste
Sweeter place
There must be a sweeter

(Place where I can)

(Place where I can)

Having no fear (No fear)
Heaven is near (Close by)
Oh whoa, head is so clear (So clear)
My sweeter place, my sweeter place
Having no fear (No fear)
Heaven is near (Close by)
Oh whoa, head is so clear (So clear)
My sweeter place, my sweeter place

Is there a place where I can hide away? (Hide away)
Red lips, french-kiss my worries all away (All away)
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugar-coat the taste
Sweeter place
There must be a sweeter

(Place where I can)
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Oh oh, tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here, oh oh
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity, oh oh
Even if it's in my dreams, oh

Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Oooooh every time I watch you serpentine

Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no, not to think about you
No, no, no, no, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no, not to give in to you

With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar

I see how your attention builds
It's like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still all we do is fear, oh oh
What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?
Paint my kiss across your chest
If you're the art, I'll be the brush

Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Oh ooh every time I watch you serpentine

Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you (not to think about you)
No, no, no, no, not to think about you (not to think about you)
No, no, no, no, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to give in to you (give it to you)
No, no, no, no, not to give in to you (give it to you)

With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar

And oh baby let's make
Reality, actuality, a reality
Oh baby let's make
Reality, actuality, a reality
Oh

Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

[Selena Gomez:]
Take it or leave it
Baby take it or leave it
But I know you won't leave it
'Cause I know that you need it
Look in the mirror
When I look in the mirror
Baby I see it clearer
Why you wanna be nearer

I'm not surprised
I sympathize
I can't deny
Your appetite

You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too

You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you

Reaching your limit
Say you're reaching your limit
Going over your limit
But I know you can't quit it
Something about me
Got you hooked on my body
Take you over and under and twisted up like origami

I'm not surprised
I sympathize
I can't deny
Your appetite

You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you

It's Gucci!
You got a fetish for my love

[Gucci Mane:]
The way you walk, the way you talk
I blame you 'cause it's all your fault
You're playin' hard, don't turn me off
You're actin' hard, but I know you soft
You my fetish, I'm so with it
All these rumors bein' spreaded
Might as well go 'head and whip it
'Cause they sayin' we already did it
Call on Gucci if you ever need me
I'll be South Beach in the drop top gleamin'
Water diamonds, Aquafina
Just need you in a blue bikini

[Selena Gomez:]

I had a dream
We were sipping whiskey neat
Highest floor, the Bowery
Nowhere's high enough
Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough

No, I don't wanna know
Where you been or where you're going
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own

Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
It ain't me

(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
It ain't me
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
It ain't me
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
It ain't me
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
It ain't me

I had a dream
We were back to seventeen
Summer nights and The Libertines
Never growing up
I'll take with me
The Polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave
Behind the worst of us

Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?

It ain't me, no, no
It ain't me, no, no
It ain't me, no, no
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
It ain't me

(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
It ain't me
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
It ain't me
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
It ain't me
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
It ain't me
(The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
It ain't me
Na na nanana The Bowery, na na nanana whiskey neat
(Grateful, I'm so grateful)
It ain't me
Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with the cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you (feeling about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it, even though I do (even though I do)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you

I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playing and re-playing old conversations
Over-thinking every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me ('Cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hiding
Everybody knows we got unfinished business
And I regret it if I didn't say this isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you

I know I'd go back to you
I go back to you
I go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you

You know, my thoughts are running loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you

I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(I go back to you, I go back to you)
I know I'd go back to you
In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love, and one to lose
Sweet divine, a heavy truth
Water or wine, don't make me choose

I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you

To get to you
To get to you

Your fingertips trace my skin
To places I have never been
Blindly, I am following
Break down these walls and come on in

I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you

To get to you
To get to you

I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you
You got my eye
And I'm tryin' to holla at ya
You're walking by
And I trip on the furniture
I'm on my ride down
Won't stop movin'
And I don't know exactly what I'm doin'
I see you shake, shake,
And I'm spinnin'
It's like a one win race
Yeah, I'm winnin'
I'm all dizzy when you're here with me
So, let's bring the heat

Off the ground

And I can't come down
My heart's pumpin'
And it's workin' overtime
I got the crazy butterflies
We're doin' it right
When we work together
I'll give up my side
It don't get better
If you want my team
Gotta figure it out
It's you and me
No doubt,

[CHORUS]
There ain't nothin' to it
Just gotta do it
You got to own it, own it
Move to the beat of
Your own drum
When it's hot like that (Burn it up like that)

Disappear
I remember the first time
But it wasn't the last time
That you told me that
You'd take me back
So I'm still wondering why
It was ever a question
I should have learned my lesson
I keep coming back
Like a heart attack
That's always breaking
I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone

You say you don't need me
You say, "this time believe me"
I'm not gonna let you disappear {disappear}
I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear {disappear}

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Disappear

I don't wanna be lonely
But you were always the only
One who cast a spell
And made it feel
Like all of this was real
Nothing but an illusion
But I'm not gonna lose ya
So just do your trick
And make it quick
Cause I'm pretending
I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone

You say you don't need me
You say, "this time believe me"
I'm not gonna let you disappear {disappear}
I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear {disappear}

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Disappear

Don't go

There's no magic when you're gone

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Disappear

You say you don't need me
You say, "this time believe me"
I'm not gonna let you disappear {disappear}
I don't wanna hear it

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Disappear {disappear}
Don't go, disappear
Well you know everything's gonna be a breeze
At the end will no doubt justify the means 
You can fix any problem with the slightest ease
(Yes please)

But you might find out it'll go to your head
When you write a report, on a book you've never read 
And with the snap of your fingers, you can make your bed! 
(That's what I said)

Everything is not what it seems 
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems 

Everything is not what it seems, 
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things 
Because everything is not....what it seems
No one love you like I love you
I never cheated, never lied
I never put no one above you
I gave you space and time
And now you're telling me you miss me
And I'm still on your mind
We were one in a million
Our love is hard to find

Do you stay up late
Just so you don't dream?

Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me, I want you to feel me
Every time you dance with somebody
I want you to feel me, I want you to feel me
Do your days get a little bit longer?
Nights get a little bit colder?
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Days get a little bit longer?
Nights get a little bit colder?
Heart beat a little bit louder?

When you're running, who you run to?
Where do you go to hide?
When she ain't giving you enough to
Get you through the night
I won't be caught up in the middle
Through your highs and your lows
Baby, 'long as you're not with me
You'll always be alone

Do you stay up late
Just so you don't dream?

Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me, I want you to feel me
Every time you dance with somebody
I want you to feel me, I want you to feel me
Do your days get a little bit longer?
Nights get a little bit colder?
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Days get a little bit longer?
Nights get a little bit colder?
Heart beat a little bit louder?

Watch all the flowers
Dance with the wind
Listen to snowflakes
Whisper your name
Feel all the wonder
Lifting your dreams
You can fly
(Fly)

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly
To your heart

Touch every rainbow
Painting the sky
Look at the magic
Glide through your life
A sprinkle of pixie dust circles the night
You can fly

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly

Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings
Fly
You can fly
To your heart
(Fly, fly)

Rise to the heights of all you can be
(Fly, Fly)
Soar on the hope of marvelous things

(Key Change!)
Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly

Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings
Fly
You can fly
To your heart

You’re being a jerk now wait
Do you play the riff twice and then I go in
Ok, ready

It will better you very soon, oh yeah
Rely on your friends
They’ll get you through
They’re there for you, oh yeah
Hold on
And suddenly you find your way
Hold on
Till yesterday is far away
Don’t let it get you down
It will bury you, very soon, oh yeah
Come into your own
And then let it go
Don’t you know, oh yeah
Hold on
And suddenly you find your way
Hold on
Till yesterday is far away

When you’ve had enough of everything
All is left is let it go
Hold on
And suddenly you find your way
Hold on
Till yesterday is far away

Hold on
And suddenly you find your way
Hold on
Till yesterday is far away

[Partial Chorus:]
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course

[Verse 1:]
I'm slippin' down a chain reaction
And here I go, here I go, here I go, go
And once again, I'm yours in fractions
It takes me down, pulls me down, pulls me down low

[Pre-Chorus:]
Honey, it's rainin' tonight
But storms always have an eye, have an eye
Tell me your cover tonight
Or tell me lies, tell me lies, lies, lies...

[Chorus:]
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me, we're the same force
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course

[Post-Chorus:]
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light

[Verse 2:]
I'm better under your reflection
But did you know, did you know, did you know, know
That's anybody else that's met ya
It's all the same, all the same, all the same glow

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Drop:]
You and me run the same course
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

I've never been awake
I've never seen a day break
Leaning on my pillow in the morning
Lazy day in bed
Music in my head
Crazy music playing in the morning light

It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

I love a sunny day
Dream of far away
Dreaming on my pillow in the morning
I've never been awake
I've never seen a day break
Leaning on my pillow in the morning light

It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so
Never believe
Just drive, I'm sick of talking
We know where this is going
I'm done, take me home
I can't wait forever
For you to get yourself together
I'd rather be alone
I'm so tired of pretending
Just want a happy ending

Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true

You taught me what I know
Guys like you come and go
But I know things can change
See, my heart, it may be broken
But that won't stop me hoping

Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
Make it all come true

I just wanna know what we should have done
Wanna figure out what we could have become
Cause I know in my heart I'm not over you
I just wanna go back and try it again
Turn back the time, this isn't the end of us
It isn't the end of us, it isn't the end of us

(whoa) Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? (oh) So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true

Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true
1 2 3 !
Uh, uh
Ye-oww !
(Ice Ice)
[Laugh]

You won't know anything unless you try
Might endup falling but you just might fly
You know it's all about what you believe
And maybe something extra up your sleeve

Listen what I say
Nothings getting in our way
There's no fear that can stop us
And no reason to delay
Gonna give it all we got
Yeah we ain't afraid to play
So watch out for it, we're gonna
Make it happen

I won't be whining about
what might've been
You know i'm not too big on giving in
I use whatever spell the law allows
That is of course, if I knew how

Listen what I say
Nothings getting in our way
There's no fear that can stop us
And no reason to delay
Gonna give it all we got
Yeah we ain't afraid to play
So watch out for it, we're gonna
Make it happen

You won't know anything unless you try
Might endup falling but you just might fly
You know it's all about what you believe
And maybe something extra up your sleeve

Listen what I say
Nothings getting in our way
There's no fear that can stop us
And no reason to delay
Gonna give it all we got
Yeah we ain't afraid to play
So watch out for it, we're gonna
Make it happen

We're not afraid to fall
Yeah we're going for it all
There's no nothing to our madness
Yeah we're answering the call
If we used a little magic
Well we really can't recall
All i Know is that we're gonna
Make it happen
Ye-oww !
[Drew]
Ever tried to reach for something
But it's someone else's dream
Every step that you take forward
Takes you right back where you've been

And then when you least expect it
And you tried about everything
Somebody hears your opinion
Somebody cares what you see

[Both]
You woke me up
No longer tired
[Drew]
With you I feel inspired
You help me find my fire

You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for "paid, young
Taking on the world from the driver's seat"
You look so classic, fantastic
When you own that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Let me see you do that

Tryin' to do it right
Ain't no rehearsal, it's your life
And you're doing this crazy dance
'Cause you're making these crazy plans

[Selena]
It's just a dance, not a test
You put in work to be the best
It's a classic take on a brand new game
[Both]
Before the needle drops, they're gonna know your name

[Drew]
When it gets old don't lose the love
[Both]
You're cold I'll warm you up (you up)
[Drew]
Your fire's hot enough, enough, enough, enough, enough

[Both]
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for "paid, young, and trying everything
Just to touch your dreams"
You look so classic, fantastic
And when you own that floor
Bring the beat back once more
(bring it back once more)
Let me see you do that

[Selena]
It's become so hard
For me to be surprised
[Drew]
You're bringing back the real me
No judgement in your eyes

[Both]
'Cause when I dance with you
It's how I speak the truth
Just classic when we met
Now you made me new

[Drew]
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
'Cause you're paid, young, and taking on the world
From the driver's seat
You look so classic, fantastic
When you own that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Bring the beat back once more

[Both]
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
'Cause you're paid, young, taking on the world
From the driver's seat
You look so classic, fantastic
When you own that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Bring it back bring it back
Let me see you do that

You're the new classic
You're the music
You're the PYT
The PYT
Stands for "paid, young, taken the chance to believe in me"
You're the new classic, fantastic
When you own that floor
When you own that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Bring the beat back once more
Let me see you do it
[Selena:]
You come from here,
I come from there.

[Demi:]
You rock out in your room,
I rock a world premiere.

We're more alike than
Anybody could ever tell
(ever tell)

[Demi:]
Friday, we're cool,
Monday, we're freaks.

[Selena:]
Sometimes we rule,
Sometimes we can't even speak.

[Demi:]
But we kick it off,
Let loose, and LOL
(LOL)

[Selena:]
It may seem cliché
For me to wanna say
That you're not alone
(that you're not alone)

[Demi:]
And you can call me uncool
But it's a simple fact
I got your back

[Both:]
'Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
I think we're almost legendary.

You and me
The perfect team
Chasing down the dream
We're one and the same!

[Demi:]
I'm kinda like you,
You're kinda like me.

[Selena:]
We write the same song
In a different key

[Both:]
It's got a rhythm, you and me
Can get along
(get along)

[Selena:]
And it may seem cliché
For me to wanna say
That you're not alone
(here I go again)

[Demi:]
And you can call me uncool
But it's a simple fact
I still got your back
(I still got your back)

[Both:]
'Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
I think we're almost legendary

You and me
The perfect team
Shaking up the scene,
We're one and the same!

[Selena:]
'Cause we're one and the same

[Demi:]
We're anything but ordinary

[Selena:]
One and the same

[Demi:]
We're something more than momentary!

[Selena:]
'Cause we're one
'Cause we're one

[Demi:]
We're anything but ordinary

You and me
The perfect team
Chasing down the dream
You and me
The perfect team
Shaking up the scene,
We're one and the same!
Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
I'm moving further away
Want you near me

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I see you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
Only you, only you
Only you, only you

This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door

And all I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

Only you
I like who I am 
But I guess you don"t 
I think that I can 
But you think I won't 
Amount to anything at all 

If you love me, 
You sure show it strange 
Is there anything that you would want to change? 
I can't be your paper doll. 

[Chorus:]
I wanna be perfect, 
But I'm me 
I wanna be flawless, 
But you see 
Every little crack 
Every chip, 
Every dent 
Every little mistake, 
I wanna be perfect 
Just like you, 
But there's only so much that a girl can do 
When I look in the mirror, 
It makes sense to me, 
Perfectly 
Perfectly 

I like worn out shoes 
You like high heels, and fantasies 
But I'm what's real 
I guess you could say 
The shoe don't fit 
Maybe I'm from Venus 
You're from mars 
My imperfections are what they are 
I guess one of us must deal, with it 

[Chorus:]
I wanna be perfect, 
But I'm me 
I wanna be flawless, 
But you see 
Every little crack, 
Every chip, 
Every dent, 
Every little mistake, yeah 
I wanna be perfect, 
Just like you 
But there's only so much, 
That a girl can do 
When I look, 
In the mirror, 
What I see, 
Makes sense to me, yeah 
Perfectly 
Oh, perfectly 

I try to fit 
In the mold 
That you make 
But I'm tired of playing 
This little charade 

[Chorus:]
I wanna be perfect, 
But I'm me 
I wanna be flawless, 
But you see 
Every little crack, 
Every chip, 
Every dent, 
Every little mistake, yeah 
I wanna be perfect, 
Just like you 
But there's only so much, 
That a girl can do 
When I look, 
In the mirror, 
What I see 
Makes sense to me, yeah 
Perfectly
Happier times
Flash through my mind
We both say it's over and
I believe it this time
All the pain that I hide
Let it play through the night

A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade, we almost got it right
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade, for every broken heart tonight

All the love that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade

I won't regret what I won't forget
Memories and your number
Are all I have left

I wish you the best, I really do
Even though I know that I'm still not over you
I know that we both are to blame
I can't believe, you didn't fight harder for me

It's a sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade, we almost got it right
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade, for every broken heart tonight

All the love that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade

The more you love, the more it hurts
When it ends, when it's over
All that's left are the memories
Playing over, and over

In your head, in your heart
Turn it up, make it stop
Tonight, all over the world
The most beautiful song ever heard

Is a sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade, we almost got it right
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade, for every broken heart tonight

All the love that we made
Turn it up, let it play

A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
A sad, sad serenade
[Fetty Wap:]
I am so sick, I'm hoping you notice, yeah baby
So sick of the same old love
Like a dose of the same old drug, yeah baby
Really starting to get under my skin
When you see signs, get with it, yeah baby
Tell me why, love's a lie

[Selena Gomez:]
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, now

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)

I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know

You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, now

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)

[Fetty Wap:]
Swear it drives me crazy
So sick of the same old love baby
And I don't mean to make you cry baby
I thought can be by your side baby
Thought you were my ride or die baby
So sick of the same old love baby
And I don't mean to make you cry baby
Thought you were my ride or die baby

[Selena Gomez:]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
[Verse 1: Nick and Miley]
A word is just a word
Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
Til you give it away
We've all gotta give
Yeah something to give
To make a change

[Chorus: Nick and Miley]
Send it on, on and on
Just one that can heal another
Be apart
Reach your heart
Just one spark starts the fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong shine a light and send it on

[Verse 2: Demi and Joe]
Just smile and the world
Will smile along with you
That small act of love
That's meant for one will become two
If we take the chances
To change circumstances
Imagine all we can do if we..

[Chorus: Everyone]
Send it on, on and on
Just one that can heal another
Be apart
Reach your heart
Just one spark starts the fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make us strong shine a light and send it on

[Bridge: Selena Gomez]
Send it on...
There's power in all of the choices we make
So i'm starting now there's not a moment to waste
A words just a word
Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
Til you give it away

[Chorus: Everyone]
Send it on, on and on
Just one that can heal another
Be apart
Reach your heart
Just one spark starts the fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make us strong shine a light and send it on

[Chorus: Everyone]
Send it on, on and on
Just one that can heal another
Be apart
Reach your heart
Just one spark starts the fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make us strong shine a light and send it on
Shine a light and send it on
Shine a light and send it on
Don't like waiting [2x]
Let's go right now!
Gotta hit the ground
Dancing 'fore the music slows down

What I'm sayin' [2x]
If there's something to fix
Take it to another level,
This is the remix

Everybody, everybody
Get out on the floor
It can get a little crazy
When the kick hits the floor

Make a scene [2x]
Nobody can ignore
Don't knock it, 'til you rock it
We can't take it no more!

Bring the lights up!
Bust the doors down!
Dust yourself off,
Shake it up!
Shake it up!

DJ set it off!
Take it up a notch
All together now!
Shake it up!
Shake it up!

Shake it up!

Break it down [2x]
I've got something to say
When you're dancin' with me,
It's like we go MIA

Make a scene [2x]
Nobody can ignore
Don't knock it, 'til you rock it
We can't take it no more!

Bring the lights up!
Bust the doors down!
Dust yourself off,
Shake it up!
Shake it up!

DJ set it off!
Take it up a notch
All together now!
Shake it up!
Shake it up!

Sh-sh-sh-shake it up,
You gotta change it up!
And if the day's not right
Just brush it off tonight!

Put on the attitude!
You're in my pocket mood
And when you've had enough,
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up!

[3x]
Bring the lights up!
Bust the doors down!
Dust yourself off,
Shake it up!
Shake it up!
DJ set it off!
Take it up a notch
All together now!
Shake it up!
Shake it up!

[3x:]
Shake it up!
Shake it up!
You were the one, the one that I could run to
You were the one, the one that I would beg for, no
And you were the one that made me believe that I could be better
Yeah, you were the one, the one that I would run to

Now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I'm stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I'm stained by you
(By you, by you, oh oh)

You had a way of making me feel special, yeah
Then take it away and say I wasn't special, no
And now it's messed up
That bad kind of love is the only thing that makes me better
Yeah you had your way, I'm trying to pull myself together

'Cause now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I'm stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I'm stained by you
(By you, by you, oh oh)

Oh, it should be easy to let you go
But I love you and I hate that you know
It should be easy to let you go
But I love you and I hate that you know

Now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I'm stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I'm stained by you
(By you, by you, oh oh)
Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me
You can sleep safe and sound
Knowing I am around

Slip into silent slumber
Sail on a silver mist
Slowly and surely your senses
Will cease to resist

Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me

Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me

Slip into silent slumber
Sail on a silver mist
Slowly and surely your senses
Will cease to resist

Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me
[Selena Gomez:]
Feeling so good, so great
Until I really look into your eyes
Tell me how bad it is, what you did
'Cause you know that I'm not about that life

Your secrets have secrets, that's no lie
Why we gotta be so under the weather
We can only have ourselves, can't rely on nobody else
To put your pieces back together

Over and over again
Repeat what you already did
What did you find?
Nothing has fixed what they said
Except that we don't understand
Why do they lie?

It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide (yeah, yeah)
Easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide

Never would give you away
You'll be unfamiliar with pain
You'll never cry

[Justin Bieber:]
I've been feeling down for a while
Wishing you could see beyond my eyes
You know very well what I did
Swear that I'm not about that life

I told you my secrets that made you cry
Said you want the truth thought it'd make you feel better
We can only grow from here
Do reconstruction
And put the pieces back together (yeah)

[Selena Gomez:]
Over and over again
Repeat what you already did
What did you find? (I was wrong, I was wrong)
Nothing has fixed what they said
Except that we don't understand
Why do they lie?

It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide (yeah, yeah)
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide

[Maejor Ali:]
Yeah, If I told you that I miss you
Would you understand it?
Or would you take it for granted?
I miss the little things, talks about the stars and the planets
And you speaking to me in Spanish, "Te extraño"
Can't even lie
Lately things have been different
You was my sweet tooth
Now it seems I need a filling
And now that the pain is numb, I'm looking for a feeling
The fast life isn't as appealing
You still listening?
If you are, I wonder how you have been nowadays
I know we haven't talked much since we parted ways
I know I missed your birthday, a couple of holidays
I never knew it'd be this hard with you far away
Secrets, all this over some secrets
I look back and tell myself to keep it
I wish that I had looked you in the eye and just told you a lie
'Cause I cared too much to see you cry

[Selena Gomez:]
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide (yeah, yeah)
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide
